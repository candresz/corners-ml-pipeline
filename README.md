# AI Corners Prediction Model

This repository contains a fully functional binary classification model using XGBoost to predict whether a football match will have **over or under 11.5 total corners**.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Trains on real match data from 2016–2025 using the API-Football service
- Predicts whether a match will have **12+ corners (OVER)** or **11 or fewer (UNDER)**
- Uses advanced features such as:
  - Shot and possession efficiency
  - Corner-to-attack ratios
  - SHAP value explanations
  - Permutation-based feature importance
- Automatically evaluates upcoming matches
- Builds **parlay suggestions** based on high-confidence predictions

---

## 🧠 Betting Strategy Overview

- Each parlay is composed of **2 matches**
- It's recommended to bet in **blocks of 50 parlays (≈100 matches)** to smooth out variance
- The model has been **validated on 90+ parlays (~180 matches)** with real match data
- Expected win rate: **64%**
  - Historical range: **59% to 69%**, depending on match conditions
- **Unprofitable leagues have been removed** from prediction (as shown in the images)
- All predictions are based on historical performance; results are not guaranteed

## 🎯 How the Model Chooses Parlays

The model only creates a parlay if the **combined calibrated probability is ≥ 64%**.

How calibration works:
1. Let's say match A has an 85% raw probability. The calibration map says this maps to 89%.
2. Match B has an 80% raw probability. Calibrated: 80%.
3. Combined: 0.89 × 0.80 = **71.2% calibrated success rate**, so it's included in the list.

Thresholds are derived from real match validations using historical accuracy at different probability levels.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to insert your API key in the script:
```python
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

## 🔐 Notes

- This model uses public match data from the RapidAPI Football API
- Make sure your plan supports historical and fixture stats endpoints
- All results are empirical, based on real matches and league performance
- The script can be used for research, model improvement, or practical betting strategies

Sports outcomes are inherently uncertain. While this model is built and validated on real data, no outcome is guaranteed. Always bet responsibly.

## 🔧 Tips & Customization

### Changing League or Country
By default, the model uses the English Premier League (league ID 135).  
To change this, modify the line in `train_model.py`:

```python
params = {"league": 135, "season": season}
```

You can find league IDs from the API-Football documentation or use the "leagues" endpoint.

---

### Handling API Errors
If the script doesn't return results, check the following:
- You may have reached your API call limit.
- Your API key might be incorrect or expired.
- There may be no upcoming matches scheduled (`status.short == 'NS'`).
- A league might not have sufficient data for predictions.

---

### Output Format
All predictions and results are printed to the console:
- Probabilities for UNDER and OVER
- Match recommendations
- Calibrated parlay combinations

**Sample output:**

```
📅 2025-05-20 - Chelsea vs Everton
  🔮 UNDER 11.5 Probability: 83.1%
  🔮 OVER 11.5 Probability: 16.9%
  ✅ RECOMMENDED: Bet UNDER 11.5 with high confidence

✅ UNIQUE Parlays with calibrated combined probability ≥ 64%:
  • Chelsea vs Everton + PSG vs Lyon → 71.2%
```

---

### Saving the Model (Optional)
You can save the trained model for reuse with:

```python
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, "corner_model.pkl")
```

And later load it with:

```python
model = joblib.load("corner_model.pkl")
```

This avoids re-training every time you want to predict.

---

### Optional: Export to CSV
If you'd like to export the predictions instead of just printing them:

```python
df_predictions.to_csv("predictions.csv", index=False)
```
